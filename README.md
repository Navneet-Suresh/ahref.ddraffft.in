You can get started with your own static page within minutes, with this you need not pay a single dime to host your website as
it's hosted by GitHub for __free__.

**Just follow the below steps and your website would be live in no time:**

1. Fork this repo by hitting the `Fork` button at the top right corner.
2. Enable github pages from the repo settings.
3. Make the required changes in the index.html.
4. Add your own custom domain in `CNAME` file or just remove the file if you don't own a domain and use the default domain that github provides ([yourusername].github.io).
5. Optionally enable HTTPS.
6. And that's it, your website is set. To view, go to [the link](https://ahref.n4vn33t.com) (or whatever you have in the CNAME file) and if you don't have one, you can go to [[yourusername].github.io/photography](http://yourusername.github.io/photography)
